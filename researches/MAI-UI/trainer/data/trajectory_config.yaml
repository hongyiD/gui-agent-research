# Configuration for trajectory.jsonl to SFT conversion
# Usage: python process_trajectory_jsonl.py --config trajectory_config.yaml

# Input path (trajectory.jsonl file or directory containing trajectories)
input: "../../dataset/20260119_201327/trajectory.jsonl"

# Output path (JSONL file for single input, or directory for batch processing)
output: "../../dataset/processed/sft_train.jsonl"

# Image format: "base64" (embedded in JSON) or "path" (file paths only)
# Use "base64" for direct training compatibility
# Use "path" for faster processing and smaller files
image_format: "base64"

# Maximum samples per trajectory (-1 for all steps)
max_samples: -1

# Image processing options
image_processing:
  # Maximum image dimensions (width, height) for resizing, null for original
  max_size: null  # e.g., [1920, 1080]

  # JPEG quality for compression (0-100), only applicable if format is changed
  jpeg_quality: 95

# Filtering options
filtering:
  # Only include successful steps
  only_successful: true

  # Minimum step index to include (0-indexed)
  min_step: 0

  # Maximum step index to include (-1 for no limit)
  max_step: -1
